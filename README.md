Random Walk Simulation Using a Biased Coin.

Here, I simulate the random walk using a biased coin that outputs heads with probability θ and tails with probability (1−θ) on each ”toss”, where θ= 0.75. I then plot the distribution of position in the cases N={50,100,150} as a histogram.

In each case sample, first, I sample more than 1000 random walks to generate the histogram.

Second, I compare the theoretically predicted (approximate) Gaussian distribution to the simulated result by plotting the Gaussian on top of the Histogram.

Finally, the plots are both both normalized in the same way so they can be compared on the same axes.
